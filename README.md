# Radio Toolkit

Some scripts for [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm) that I felt I needed for radio and podcast production. 

## Installation

It's easiest to install Radio Toolkit using [ReaPack](https://reapack.com). After installing it, find the ReaPack menu in Reaper, select `Import repositories...` and enter the following URL:

```
https://github.com/tomtjes/Radio-Toolkit/raw/master/index.xml
```

Alternatively, feel free to download individual script and import them into Reaper, e.g. using the `Actions` list.
